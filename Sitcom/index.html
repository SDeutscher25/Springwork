<p>
An FBI Special Agent in NYC, OA made it from Bushwick to West Point, where he became an Army Ranger.
He has both the confidence - and the will - of someone whoâ€™s had to fight every step of the way.
After spending two years undercover, the DEA abruptly ripped him out, and he was cherry-picked by
the FBI.

<p>
Maggie is an agent who, her bosses and peers agree, is marked for success. Born into a
multigenerational law enforcement family in the Midwest, Maggie has developed a sophisticated skill
set: high emotional IQ, intellectual rigor, bracing candor. She engages immediately, commits deeply,
to the people she works with and is protecting. Maggie came to New York with conviction - and is
working incredibly hard not to let a recent personal tragedy derail her new life, personally or
professionally.

<h2>Jubal Valentine</h2>

</div>
<p>
He is in the sweet spot of his FBI career: experienced enough to honcho a sophisticated response,
energetic enough to keep his team motivated. His ability to relate and engage easily to subordinates
and superiors makes him "good glue" and sets him up as the nerve center of the office. Everybody
thinks they know the "real" man, but as open as he is, if you look closely, he takes in much more
than he puts out. Jubal has a great sense of humor and usually enjoys making puns. According to some
of his comments, he is very fond of baseball.

<p>
Agent Stuart Scola, a silver-tongued, fast-talking, quick-witted former Wall Streeter-turned-FBI
Special Agent in NYC. He's a Reddit-exploring Ivy Leaguer whose do-gooder sensibilities belie his
born-and-bred New York cynicism. He attended Princeton, and then worked at Goldman Sachs for 7
years. He has a younger sister, Alexandra. His older brother, Doug Scola, died in 9/11
